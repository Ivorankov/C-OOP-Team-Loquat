## Telerik Academy Team Project – March 2015
### "Team Loquat"
##### Object-Oriented Application: "Loquat Mega Store"

*Loquat Mega Store is an online electronics store, meant primarily for large electronic products such as TV sets, computers (desktop and mobile), radio sets, phones, etc. A special accessories category for smaller items can of course be added if needed. The project is meant to serve as a basis for any straightforward shop made with C#.
The partially implemented user interface is meant to provide a quick preview of the project.*

## Assignment Details and Requirements

Design and implement an object-oriented application by choice. Here are some suggestions:

 *  A game:
  The world can be fantasy, sci-fi, modern, etc.
  You may have one or more heroes, gaining experience, having skills, wearing items, etc.
  You may have one or more players, fighting against a computer or against each other
  You may have enemies like creatures, machines, warriors, etc.
  You may have items like swords, guns, armor, space-suits, etc.
  You may have skills like double-damage, teleportation, etc.
 *  A line-of-business application
  TODO list application, TODOs can have a deadline, priorities, types etc.
  Calendar application, keeping meetings with places and date, having notifications, etc.
  Social network, with different users, different roles, friend list, user information, chat between users, groups of users, etc.
  A chat application, supporting user-to-user chats, channels, group chats, friends-list, starred users, etc.

General Requirements

Please define and implement the following object-oriented assets in your project:

 *  At least 5 interfaces (with one or more implementations)
 *  At least 15 classes (implementing the application logic)
 *  At least 3 abstract classes (with inheritors)
 *  At least 1 custom exception class (with usage in your code)
 *  At least 3 levels of depth in inheritance
 *  At least 1 polymorphism usage
 *  At least 1 structure
 *  At least 1 enumeration
 *  At least 1 event (with subscribers)
 *  At least 1 design pattern (e.g. Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command, etc.) You might read about design patterns in Wikipedia, Sourcemaking, DoFactory and others.

Additional Requirements

 * Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use delegates and events like it is recommended in MSDN, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling.
 * Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use https://github.com/). TFS or SVN are not allowed. Use Git.
 *  Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types).

Optional Requirements

If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:

 * Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.)
 * Constants, generic types, indexers, operators
 * Lambda expressions and LINQ
 * Implementation of IEnumerable, ICloneable, ToString() override
 * Namespaces (if your classes are too much)
 * User interface (UI) – console, graphical, web or mobile

Non-Required Work

Completely finished project is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly. This team work project is for educational purpose. Its main purpose it to experience object-oriented modeling and OOP in a real-world project and to get some experience in team working and team collaboration with Git.
